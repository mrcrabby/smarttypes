BRIEF OUTLINE
Networks, social networks, chaos & complexity, prediction, big data: just a few of the buzzwords in a technologist's vocabulary today. Social scientists of yore would be amazed to see the data & tools the average hacker has at their disposal. Large scale social studies were a luxury enjoyed by an elite few, the best public source of info, a ten year census. Today, we have more social data than we know what to do with.

This is from a recent DARPA request for proposals:

- Recognize persuasion campaign structures and influence operations across social media sites and communities.
- Counter messaging of detected adversary influence operations. 
- Identify participants and intent, and measure effects of persuasion campaigns.

These are a few of the things people, governments, and big business are doing w/ social data.

I want to talk about my python-based open-source side-project (probably the most hyphenated words i've ever strung together):

http://www.smarttypes.org/

SmartTypes is concerned w/ mapping our social world.  I don't mean showing where twitter users live on a geographic map (although that would be cool).  I'm talking about reducing a social network to 2 dimensions, while preserving the essence of the network.  I'll explain more.

This project has exposed me to a lot of interesting libraries and ideas: 

- twitter scraping (oauth & tweepy)
- parallel processing (multiprocessing)
- linear algebra (numpy & scipy)
- network analysis (networkx & igraph)
- machine learning (scikit-learn)
- gis (postgis)
- web mapping tools (tillmile & leaflet) 
- distributed graph analysis (pregel & graphlab) 
- graph theory
- statistics and probability
- agent based modeling

DETAILED ABSTRACT
Networks are a convenient (fertile) abstraction. At a high level, networks are about objects and relationships between objects. It's surprising how much can be done w/ this simple abstraction. I'll focus on social network analysis, but these same methods and tools can be applied to any network (gene expression network, network of pages on the web, percolation of diseases, linguistic lexical networks, ...).

There's a lot one can do within the umbrella of network analysis. I'll focus specifically on reducing a network to 2 dimensions.  I think of this as network compression. This problem is commonly called 'graph embedding':

Getting the data

Making a social map

Display and interaction

One map to rule them all


ADDITIONAL NOTES
SmartTypes is entirely open source software. You can check out the source tree at https://github.com/smarttypes/smarttypes

This would be my first time speaking at a conference like PyCon. I spoke about this (when i was first starting the project) at pyohio in 2011:

http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4380/pyohio-2011-using-pymc-to-clus

I've since gained a lot of technical insight & direction.  This talk will be 95% technical.  I feel like my 2011 pyohio talk was too abstract and philosophical. This talk will be much more technical and to the point.

Here’s what I’m thinking for timing:

Intro (5 min)
- Who am I?
- What's this talk about
- Networks (a handy abstraction)
- Some examples of network analysis today

Getting the data (5 min)
- Twitters terms of service
- Getting auth tokens
- Pulling & storing twitter info

Making a social map (5 min)
- Dimension reduction
- Network embedding
- Why 
- Community detection
- Similarity
- Location based indexing

Display and interaction (5 min)
- Web maps
- Canvas vs. SVG vs. Imagine tiling
- Tilemill
- Leaflet
- A quick look at the UI

One map to rule them all (5 min)
- Enter distributed graph analysis 
- MapReduce & Pregel (similarities & differences)
- Graphlab (asynchronous & disk-based)
- The life of a vertex
- Individual and collective objective
- Dealing w/ incomplete information 
- Belief propagation & partial derivatives (a simple perspective)

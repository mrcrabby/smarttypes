I prefer a 30 minute slot

BRIEF OUTLINE
Networks, social networks, chaos & complexity, prediction, big data: these are just a few of the buzzwords in a technologist's vocabulary today. Social scientists 'of yore' would be thrilled to see the data & tools the average hacker has at their disposal. Large scale social studies were a luxury enjoyed by an elite few, the best public source of info, a ten year census. Today, we have more social data than we know what to do with.

This is from a recent DARPA request for proposals:

- Recognize persuasion campaign structures and influence operations across social media sites and communities.
- Counter messaging of detected adversary influence operations. 
- Identify participants and intent, and measure effects of persuasion campaigns.

These are a few of the things people, governments, and big business are doing w/ social data.

I want to talk about my python-based open-source side-project (probably the most hyphenated words i've ever strung together):

http://www.smarttypes.org/

SmartTypes is concerned w/ mapping our social world.  I don't mean showing where twitter users live on a geographic map (although that would be cool).  I'm talking about reducing a social network to 2 dimensions, while preserving the essence of the network.  I'll explain more.

This project has exposed me to a lot of interesting libraries and ideas: 

- twitter scraping (oauth & tweepy)
- parallel processing (multiprocessing)
- linear algebra (numpy & scipy)
- network analysis (networkx & igraph)
- machine learning (scikit-learn)
- gis (postgis)
- web mapping tools (tillmile & leaflet) 
- distributed graph analysis (pregel & graphlab) 
- graph theory
- statistics and probability
- agent based modeling

DETAILED ABSTRACT
Networks are a convenient (fertile) abstraction. At a high level, networks are about objects and relationships between objects. It's surprising how much can be done w/ this simple abstraction. I'll talk about social network analysis, but the same methods and tools can be applied to any network (gene expression network, network of pages on the web, percolation of diseases, linguistic lexical networks, so forth and so on...).

There's a lot one can do within the umbrella of network analysis. I'll focus specifically on reducing a network to 2 dimensions. I'll explain more. Think of this as network compression, this is commonly called 'graph embedding'.

*Getting the data
There has been a lot of talk about twitter's rate limits. I will talk about the newest (1.1) version, and differences from the prior version. Sad spoiler: we can pull 1/6 of the data. Even so, it's still possible to pull a lot of data (thousands and millions of users).

I will also talk about getting & storing the data.

*Making a social map
Reducing the dimensionality of graphs is actually an easy concept when you understand the Adjacency Matrix: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix

I will describe the adjacency matrix and how we'll go about reducing it to 2 dimensions, so that distance on our 2 dimensional plane is the same as similarity (technically dis-similarity). Happy spoiler: our objective function is incredible simple.

*Display and interaction
I will talk about different web mapping options (canvas, svg, and tiled images). I'll also talk about handy 

*One map to rule them all


ADDITIONAL NOTES
SmartTypes is entirely open source software. You can check out the source tree at https://github.com/smarttypes/smarttypes

This would be my first time speaking at a conference like PyCon. I spoke about this (when i was first starting the project) at pyohio in 2011:

http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4380/pyohio-2011-using-pymc-to-clus

I've since gained a lot of technical insight & direction.  This talk will be 95% technical.  I feel like my 2011 pyohio talk was too abstract and philosophical. This talk will be much more technical and to the point.

Here’s what I’m thinking for timing:

Making a social map (5 min)
- Dimension reduction
- Network embedding
- Why 
- Community detection

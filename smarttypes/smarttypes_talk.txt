Mapping our social world

CATEGORY
Social network analysis

AUDIENCE LEVEL
Intermediate

DURATION
I prefer a 30 minute slot

BRIEF OUTLINE
Networks, social science, chaos & complexity, prediction, big data: these are all common buzzwords in a technologist's vocabulary today. We live in a great & crazy time.  Social scientists of yore would be amazed to see the data & tools the average hacker has at their disposal. Large scale social studies were a luxury enjoyed by an elite few, the best public source of info, a ten year census. Today, we have more social data than we know what to do with.

This is from a recent DARPA request for proposals:

- Recognize persuasion campaign structures and influence operations across social media sites and communities.
- Counter messaging of detected adversary influence operations. 
- Identify participants and intent, and measure effects of persuasion campaigns.

These are a few of the things people, governments, and big business are doing w/ social data.

I want to talk about my python-based open-source side-project (probably the most hyphenated words i've ever strung together):

http://www.smarttypes.org/

SmartTypes is concerned w/ mapping our social world.  I don't mean showing where twitter users live on a geographic map (although that would be cool).  I'm talking about reducing a social network to 2 dimensions while preserving the essence of the network.  I'll explain more.

This project has exposed me to a lot of interesting libraries and ideas: 

- linear algebra (numpy & scipy)
- network (graph) analysis (networkx & igraph)
- machine learning (scikit-learn) 
- parallel processing (multiprocessing)
- distributed graph analysis frameworks (pregel & graphlab) 
- graph theory
- statistics and probability
- agent based modeling
- web mapping tools (tillmile & leaflet)

I'll explain more

DETAILED ABSTRACT

Network analysis

Dimension reduction

Community detection

Distributed graph analysis

Belief propagation 


ADDITIONAL NOTES
SmartTypes is entirely open source software. You can check out the source tree at https://github.com/smarttypes/smarttypes

This would be my first time speaking at a conference like PyCon. I spoke about this (when i was first starting the project) -- at pyohio in 2011 -- http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4380/pyohio-2011-using-pymc-to-clus

I've since gained a lot of technical experience.  This talk will be 95% technical.  I feel like my 2011 pyohio talk was to abstract, unrehearsed, and philosophical. This talk will be much more to the point and polished.

Here’s what I’m thinking for timing:

Intro (5 min)
- Who am I?
- Social science then and now
- Some examples of social network analysis today
Making a social map (10 min)
- Networks (a handy abstraction)
- Dimension reduction
- Graph reduction
- Community detection
- Web display and interaction
Scaling (mapping millions of nodes) (10 min)
- MapReduce & Pregel (similarities & differences)
- Graphlab
- Agent based modeling
- Objective function 
- Belief propagation & partial derivatives (a simple perspective)
Questions (5 mins)

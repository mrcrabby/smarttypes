Intermediate

DURATION
I prefer a 30 minute slot

BRIEF OUTLINE
Networks, social networks, chaos & complexity, prediction, big data; these are common buzzwords in a technologist's vocab. Social scientists of yore would be thrilled to see the data & tools the average hacker has at their disposal. 

This is from a recent DARPA request for proposals:

https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=6ef12558b44258382452fcf02942396a&tab=core&_cview=0

- Recognize persuasion campaign structures and influence operations across social media sites and communities.
- Counter messaging of detected adversary influence operations. 
- Identify participants and intent, and measure effects of persuasion campaigns.

These are a few of the things people, governments, and big business are doing w/ social data today.

I want to talk about my python-based open-source side-project (probably the most hyphenated words i've ever strung together):

http://www.smarttypes.org/

SmartTypes is about mapping our social world.  I don't mean showing where twitter users live on a geographic map (although that would be cool).  I mean reducing a social network to 2 dimensions (network compression). I'll explain more.

Thanks to this project, i've been exposed to a lot of new / interesting libraries and ideas: 

- Twitter data collection (oauth & tweepy)
- Parallel processing w/ python (multiprocessing)
- Linear algebra w/ python (numpy & scipy)
- Network analysis (networkx & igraph)
- Machine learning w/ python (scikit-learn)
- GIS (postgis)
- Web mapping tools (tillmile & leaflet) 
- Distributed graph analysis (pregel & graphlab) 
- Graph theory
- Statistics and probability
- Agent based modeling

DETAILED ABSTRACT
Networks are a convenient (fertile) abstraction. At a high level, networks are about objects and relationships between objects. It's surprising what can be done w/ this simple abstraction. I'll focus on social network analysis, keep in mind, the same methods and tools can be applied to any network abstraction (gene expression networks, the web, percolation of diseases, lexical networks, ...)

There's a lot one can do within the umbrella of network analysis. I'll focus on reducing a network to 2 dimensions (graph embedding), and using this reduction to index communities and similarities.

*Getting the data
Twitter rate limits have been a popular topic lately. I'll talk about the newest (1.1) version, and differences between the prior version. Sad spoiler: we can pull 1/6 of the data. Even so, we can still pull a lot of data (thousands and millions of users).

I will also talk about how i'm getting & storing the data.

*Making a social map
Reducing the dimensionality of network is an easy concept once you understand the Adjacency Matrix: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix

I will describe the adjacency matrix, and different ways to reduce the dimensionality of this matrix. Then i will talk specifically about the forced-based model i settled on. Happy spoiler: our objective function is incredibly simple.

*Display and interaction
I will talk about different web mapping options (canvas, svg, and tiled images). I'll also talk about web mapping tools tilemill & leaflet.

I'll show the application, and show a map of someone the audience knows.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
SmartTypes is entirely open source software. You can check out the source tree at https://github.com/smarttypes/smarttypes

I spoke about this (when i was first starting the project) at pyohio in 2011:

http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4380/pyohio-2011-using-pymc-to-clus

I've since gained a lot of technical insight & direction. I feel like my 2011 pyohio talk was too abstract and philosophical. This talk will be more technical and to the point.

Here’s what I’m thinking for timing:

Making a social map (5 min)
- The adjacency Matrix
- Dimension reduction
- Why 
- Similarity

- Indexing

Display and interaction (5 min)
- Web maps
- Canvas -- SVG -- Image tiling

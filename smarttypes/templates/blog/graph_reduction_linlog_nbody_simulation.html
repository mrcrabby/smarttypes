Network reduction via the linlog energy model 
</h2>

<p>
The following is about reducing the dimensionality of a network.<br/> 
Explaining the value of network reduction is a task left for another day.<br/> 
For now let's say that networks are a convenient way to represent complex problems.<br/>  
For more, see this from <a href="http://networkscience.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/why-everything-is-a-network/">a 2011 Network Science Postdoc</a>:

<blockquote>
"The trick is... Everything is a NETWORK!"

<p>
Assuming then, the inherit value in networks.<br/> 
Reducing the dimensionality of a network (squeezing out it's essence -- it's juice) is also valuable. 
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of dimension reduction methods.<br/> 
There are a lot of network analysis methods.<br/>
The method/model described here uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body">N-body Simulation</a> to reduce a network to 2 dimensions.<br/>
Reducing the dimensionality of our network this much also makes it nice and easy to relay, display and read. 
</p>

<p>
We're going start this method by scattering all the nodes in our network on a 2d surface.<br/> 
The nodes will interact w/ each other until they <b>settle to an equilibrium</b>. <br/>
This is known generally as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_minimization">Energy Minimization</a>, and is commonly used to model complex physical systems. <br/>
Fans of complexity and social science will see similarities between this and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">Agent Based Modeling</a>.
</p>

<p>
There's actually another (more interesting) motivation to network reduction.<br/> 
Reduction can help us understand the community structure of a network. <br/>
The following is from the 103 page, tour de force, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0612">Community Detection in networks</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>One of the most relevant features of networks representing real systems is community structure, or clustering...<br/><br/>
Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a network, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body.<br/>
Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as networks.<br/><br/>
This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years.

<p>
Enter, <a href="http://www-sst.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/~an/">Dr. Andreas Noack</a><br/> 
Noackâ€™s LinLog energy model is considered the best objective function for force based community detection.<br/>
The following is from Noack's 2007 paper
<a href="http://www-sst.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/~an/Publications/JGAA2007.pdf">Energy Models for network Clustering</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Edge-repulsion LinLog energy minimizes the ratio of the mean distance 
between connected end nodes to the mean distance between all end nodes.

</p>

<blockquote>
The beauty of edge repulsion lies in its symmetry: Edges cause both attraction and repulsion.<br/> 
In other words, nodes that attract strongly also repulse strongly.<br/> 
More precisely, each node has consistently (in terms of attraction and repulsion) an 
influence on the layout proportional to its degree.

<h1>Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)</h1>

<p>
This approach models the probability that a relation exists (in logit form) as a linear function of predictors. 
This formulation looks similar to logistic regression, but in fact each tie is on both sides of the equation and 
often in multiple predictors, making tie probabilities recursively dependent. 

This dependence is not a weakness of ERG models but is an inherent feature of relational data, and we model it 
explicitly rather than treating it as a nuisance parameter. 

Recent advances in computationally intensive statistics provide practical methods for solving the 
resulting estimation problems.

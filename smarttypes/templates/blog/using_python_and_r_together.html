<h1>Using python and R together</h1>

<p>
i'm a python dev, learning R -- python has it's strengths, R has it's strengths 
(more on this below)
</p>

<p>
after reading 
<a href="http://epbi-radivot.cwru.edu/EPBI415/files/wk13if2otherLangs/attic/pypeR.pdf"> 
PypeR, A Python Package for Using R in Python
</a>
<br/>
i decided file-based integration was the best way to go
</p>

<p>
python writes everything to an easily digestible file -- r reads it, does some crunching and writes 
to it's own file
</p>

<p>
the problem w/ tools like rpy is memory consumption -- this is from the paper referenced above:
</p>

<blockquote>
RPy2, a
recently developed branch of RPy, uses Python objects to refer to R objects instead of
copying them back into Python objects. This strategy avoids frequent data conversions
and improves speed. However, memory consumption remains a problem.
</blockquote>

<p>
OK -- let's address the bigger question, why python + R -- the following is from 
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/DataJunkie">Ryan Rosario's</a> rpy2 la meetup presentation:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.bytemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rpy2.pdf">http://www.bytemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rpy2.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
Rosario asks *and answers* the question
<br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">
'So, Why use python <strike>instead of</strike> with R':
</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
python has a much larger community with very diverse
interests, and text and web mining are big focuses.
</li>
<li> 
more access to datastores; not only MySQL and PostgreSQL
but also Redis and MongoDB, with more to come.
</li>
<li>
more natural object-oriented features
</li>
</ul>

<p>
so why would someone use R -- 
Rosario answers that as well:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
obviously, great analysis and visualization routines.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)</h2>

<p>
MDS is dimension reduction geared to our specific goal:
reducing a similarity matrix to a low-dimensional plane
</p>

<blockquote>
MDS, is a technique for
dimensionality reduction, where data in a measured high
dimensional space is mapped into some lower-dimensional target
space while minimizing spatial distortion.
</blockquote>

<p>
For more on our similarity matrix, see
<a href="http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/">Hanneman</a>
and
<a href="http://www.unco.edu/sociology/faculty/riddle-mark.html">Riddle's</a>:
<a href="http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/C13_%20Structural_Equivalence.html">
Measures of similarity and structural equivalence
</a>
</p>

<p>
The essence of MDS is simple:  
An objective function that compares the explicit distances in our similarity matrix 
w/ the distances implied in our reduced matrix.
The goal is to find a reduction that best approximates our original.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of different MDS (and dimension reduction) methods, 
and new one's being introduced daily it seems. 
</p>

<p>
I wanted a method w/ a sound GPU implementation.
I quickly found:

Glimmer: Multilevel MDS on the GPU
</a>

<p>
Here are the good people responsible for Glimmer:

<li><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~sfingram">Stephen Ingram</a></li>

</ul>

Here's the problem (from the Glimmer README):

<h1>Random walk graph diffusion</h1>

<p>
Biological networks are messy and complicated.
Here's a neat quote from <a href="http://www.linkgroup.hu/petercsermely.php">Péter Csermely</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
"Biological networks offer the experience of a billion years in crisis-survival - we can learn from them."
</blockquote>

<p>
This is from Péter's site:
</p>

<blockquote>
"As an ordinary biochemist, I have started to recognize the strength 
of the network approach only in 2002...
Currently I am working on the role of weak links in the interaction 
scenarios (dynamic equilibria, games) between network partners."
</blockquote>

<h2>Cosma Shalizi's class on Diffusion Maps</h2>

<p>
First a little praise of Cosma Shalizi.
<br/>
This is the sort of guy you want teaching your kids math.
He's an artist -- a poet even.
<br/>
I've never heard a mathematical method referred to as 'Biblical'.
<br/>
The following is from 
<a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/15/lecture-15.pdf">
	Shalizi's 2009 CMU class on Diffusion Maps</a>

</p>

<blockquote>
This is saying that the substance will move away from regions of high
concentration and towards ones of low concentration, until it's evenly distributed
everywhere. On the one hand, it's almost Biblical; on the other hand, it's
the mathematical expression of what we mean when in ordinary language we
say it 'oozes'.
<br/>
<br/>
-- Isaiah 40:4, "Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be laid low"

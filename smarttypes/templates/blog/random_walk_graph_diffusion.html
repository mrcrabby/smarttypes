<h2>Cosma Shalizi's class on Diffusion Maps</h2>

<p>
First -- Cosma Shalizi.
<br/>
This is the guy you want teaching your kids.
He's an artist -- a poet even.
<br/>
I've never heard a mathematical method referred to as 'Biblical'.
<br/>
The following is from 
<a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/15/lecture-15.pdf">
	Shalizi's 2009 CMU class on Diffusion Maps</a>

</p>

<blockquote>
This is saying that the substance will move away from regions of high
concentration and towards ones of low concentration, until it's evenly distributed
everywhere. On the one hand, it's almost Biblical; on the other hand, it's...
<br/>
<br/>
-- Isaiah 40:4, "Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be laid low"

<h2>A quick overview</h2>

<p>
Random walk is a Markov chain describing the sequence
of nodes visited by a random walker. 
This process can be described by the transition probability matrix, P,
with Pxy = axy/kx presenting the probability that a random walker 
staying at node x will walk to y in the next
step, where axy equals 1 if node x and node y are connected, 
0 otherwise, and kx denotes the degree of node x.

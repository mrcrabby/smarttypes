<h2>
Modeling complexity
</h2>

<!--
<p>
This post is a derivation of 
<a href="http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4380/pyohio-2011-using-pymc-to-clus">a talk i gave on complexity and social network analysis</a> 
@ <a href="http://pyohio.org/">PyOhio 2011</a> in Columbus, OH.
</p>

<p>
The main point of the talk was/is to inspire curiosity!
</p>

<p>
Developing the talk, and the project related to the talk, has been a slow journey.
I enjoy thinking about complexity, and how computers can help us model/untangle it.
The journey then, is the point i suppose.
</p>

<h2>Everything is related</h2>
-->

<p>
Life is complex!
</p>

"Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;<br/>
Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'<br/>
Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;<br/>
Man got to tell himself he understand." - Kurt Vonnegut
</p>
</blockquote>

This is the book that got be started down this path: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Making-Science-James-Gleick/dp/0140092501">Chaos: Making a New Science</a>.
I like to lump 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaos theory</a> 
and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems">modern complex systems research</a> under the same name; 'complexity science'.

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">The butterfly effect</a> 
is more than just a great movie starring man of science,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect"> Ashton Kutcher</a>.
</p> 

<p>
The butterfly effect is a simple idea.<br/>
A butterfly fluttering her wings in Casablanca can effect the weather in Cleveland, OH.<br/>
This is an example used to make a larger point:
</p>

<h2>Things are related in weird ways.</h2>

<p>
Perhaps everything is related!<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism">Here's what wikipedia has to say:</a>
(From August 23 2011):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"The philosophical argument here would be that the big bang triggered every single action, 
and possibly mental thought..."
</p>
</blockquote>

</p> -->

<p>
Also from the same wikipedia article on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism">determinism</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Because of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically... 
</p>
</blockquote>

<!--
<p>
Even if we could measure and compute everything's influence on everything else, 
we'd still run into something akin to the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a>.
In short, we need to embrace uncertainty!

<h2>Predicting the actions of humans</h2>

<p>
The stock market is a great forum for complexity analysis.<br/>
The game is simple, predict the future better than your opponents, and win a lots of $$$$.
</p>

<!--<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading#cite_note-advtrade-4">In 2009, computer driven, algorithmic trading firms accounted for 73% of all US equity trading volume</a>.

"Even apart from the instability due to speculation, there is the instability due to the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than mathematical expectations." -- John Maynard Keynes

This is interesting:<br/>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3003">Twitter mood predicts the stock market</a>.
</p>

<p>
No small feat!<br/>
The financial industry spends a lot of money on methods to predict the future.<br/>
A lot of money is an understatement.<br/>
How/why would twitter be good at predicting the market?

<h2>Human social networks</h2>

<p>
Imagine all of us as a single, interconnected system.  <br/>
A lot of people have had this thought, you've probably heard the term 'the human network'.
</p>

<p>
Taken in aggregate, the human network is an amazing analytical machine.<br/>
We experience, categorize, learn, and teach.<br/>
In this way we gain collective knowledge over time.

<p>"The Quality which creates the world emerges as a relationship between man and his experience. <br/>
	He is a participant in the creation of all things. The measure of all things." -- Robert Pirsig</p>

<h2>Online social networks</h2>

<p>
The web lets us experience, categorize, learn, and teach at the speed of light.<br/>
We're still discovering what this means.<br/>
Here are 2 examples:

This is from

Twitter texts are as timely as a pulse beat and, taken together, automatically compile the raw material of social history.

Recognize persuasion campaign structures and influence operations across social media 
sites and communities.<br/>  
Counter messaging of detected adversary influence operations. <br/>
Identify participants and intent, and measure effects of persuasion campaigns.

You might want to read that last bit again!!

OK, that sets the stage for implementation.

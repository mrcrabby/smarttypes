<h1>rpy</h1>

<p>
My first question was rpy or rpy2
<br/>
I'm still not sure
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of  
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=rpy2">
questions related to rpy2 on stackoverflow
</a>
<br/>
Not as many 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=rpy">
with just the term 'rpy'
</a>
</p>

<p>
rpy2 is a rewrite of rpy -- rewrite doesn't == better -- 
that said i was able to find some good stuff related to rpy2
<br/>
The offical documentation at the time of this writing 
<a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc-2.2/html/index.html">
is here
</a>
</p>

<p>
A lot of the following is from 
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/DataJunkie">Ryan Rosario's</a> wonderful rpy2 meetup presentation:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.bytemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rpy2.pdf">http://www.bytemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rpy2.pdf</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
RPy2 is a rewrite of RPy, providing for a more user friendly
experience and expanded capabilities
</blockquote>

<p>
Rosario asks *and nicely answers* the question
<br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">
'So, Why use python <strike>instead of</strike> with R':
</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
python has a much larger community with very diverse
interests, and text and web mining are big focuses.
</li>
<li>
state of art algorithms for text mining typically hit python or
Perl before they hit R.
</li>
<li>
parallelism does not rely on R's parallelism package
</li>
<li> 
more access to datastores; not only MySQL and PostgreSQL
but also Redis and MongoDB, with more to come.
</li>
<li>
more natural object-oriented features
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm a python dev just learning R -- so why the hell would i use R -- 
Rosario answers that as well
<br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">
'And, What are the Advantages of R over python':
</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
obviously, great analysis and visualization routines.
</li>
<li>
data frames; closest equivalent in python is a dictionary,
whose values are the lists of values for each variable, or a list
of tuples, each tuple a row.
</li>
<li>
factors; python does not even have an enum primitive data
type
</li>
</ul>

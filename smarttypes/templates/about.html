            All you create, and all you destroy!

        <p>
            All that you touch <br/>
            All that you see <br/>
            All that you taste <br/>
            All you feel. <br/>
            All that you love <br/>
            All that you hate <br/>
            All you distrust <br/>
            All you save. <br/>
            All that you give <br/>
            All that you deal <br/>
            All that you buy, <br/>
            beg, borrow or steal. <br/>
            All you create <br/>
            All you destroy <br/>
            All that you do <br/>
            All that you say. <br/>
            All that you eat <br/>
            And everyone you meet <br/>
            All that you slight <br/>
            And everyone you fight. <br/>
            All that is now <br/>
            All that is gone <br/>
            All that's to come <br/>
            and everything under the sun is in tune <br/>
            but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.

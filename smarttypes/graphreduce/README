Graphreduce is designed to reduce large networks to a 2D map.

We seek an 'accurate' reduction that highlights community structure.

We assume the entire graph won't fit into memory, which makes for an 
interesting challenge.

Here are the steps:

 1. reduce root_node's network using LinLog energy model and save
 reduction to the db

 2. use reduction to id communities and save communities to the db

 3. use reductions and communities to stitch a bunch of reductions together 
 and save to postgis

 4. use mapnik to generate image tiles

 5. use leaflet + d3 to do for the html map

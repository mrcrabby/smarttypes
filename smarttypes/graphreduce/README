Graphreduce is designed to reduce a large network to a 2D map.

Think google maps for networks.

We seek an 'accurate' reduction w/ an emphasis on finding communities.

We assume the entire network won't fit into memory.

Here are the steps:

 1. Reduce root_node's network using LinLog energy model

 2. Use DBSCAN to id communities

 3. Use NLTK to generate community labels and full_txt_idx

 4. Use TileMill and Mapnik to generate image tiles

Graphreduce is designed to reduce large networks to a 2D map.

We seek an 'accurate' reduction that highlights community structure.

We assume the entire graph won't fit into memory, which makes for an 
interesting challenge.

Here are the steps:

 1. pick a root_node

 2. reduce root_node's network using LinLog energy model

 3. identify communities

 4. identify network and community stats

 5. save everything to postgres and postgis

 6. stitch a bunch of reductions together

 7. save to postgis

 8. use mapnik to generate image tiles

 9. use leaflet + d3 to do for the html map
